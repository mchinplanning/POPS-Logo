        <a name="history"></a><h2><strong>History of POPS in New York City</strong></h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Under the public policy of  incentive zoning, New York City since 1961 has granted more than 20 million  square feet of valuable floor area bonuses and other zoning concessions to  office and residential building developers in return for close to 3.8 million square  feet of plazas, arcades, and other outdoor and indoor privately owned public  spaces. To put this in context, 20 million square feet is the equivalent of  roughly seven Empire State Buildings, and 3.8 million square&nbsp;feet&nbsp;is  equivalent to roughly nine Bryant Parks, 24 Union Squares, or 10% of Central  Park. Although the zoning rules regulating the spaces have changed over the  years, one aspect has remained constant – spaces must be open for public use,  often for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, even though they are privately  owned and managed.&nbsp;Most spaces are located in Manhattan&rsquo;s Midtown, Upper  East Side, Upper West Side, and downtown neighborhoods, but all five boroughs  have privately owned public spaces.</p>
      <p align="left">How have the more than 550 spaces  performed for the public over close to 60 years? Harvard University Professor  and Advocates for Privately Owned Public Space founder and president Jerold S.  Kayden, the New York City Department of City Planning, and The Municipal Art  Society of New York conducted a research study and co-authored the book&nbsp;<em>Privately  Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience</em>&nbsp;(New York: John Wiley  &amp; Sons 2000) in which two major conclusions were reached.</p>
      <p align="left">The first conclusion was that,  although the zoning incentives produced an impressive&nbsp;<em>quantity</em>&nbsp;of  public space, they failed to yield a similarly impressive&nbsp;<em>quality</em>&nbsp;of  public space.&nbsp;While some spaces proved to be welcome additions to the  public realm, the study and book concluded that 41% of the spaces were of  marginal value, with plazas and arcades constructed in the 1960s and early  1970s among the most problematic. The 1961 Zoning Resolution, as originally  enacted, bears significant responsibility for this outcome in that it granted  zoning bonuses without imposing meaningful legal standards governing the design  and operation of the plazas and arcades provided in return. For example, the  original zoning rules for the provision of plazas said nothing about seating,  landscaping, construction materials, or orientation to sunlight. Developers  often did little more than install paving around their buildings, call the  resulting spaces plazas, and collect the zoning bonuses, all in full compliance  with the law.</p>
      <p align="left">To improve the usability and  attractiveness of POPS, the City enacted zoning amendments in the mid-1970s  that placed higher standards on new plazas. Stirred in part by the work of  pioneering urban observer William H. Whyte and his Street Life Project, the  amendments required amenities such as seating, landscaping, bike racks, drinking  fountains, and identification signage. Not surprisingly, use of the plazas  produced under these new standards increased significantly. Over time, the  Department of City Planning has continued to revise standards so that POPS are  useful and inviting to the public, most recently with the adoption of new  standards for &ldquo;public plazas&rdquo; in 2007 and 2009.</p>
      <p align="left">The study&rsquo;s and book&rsquo;s second  conclusion was that, in a substantial number of cases, POPS owners discouraged  or prevented public use of their space through illegal  privatization.&nbsp;Field surveys conducted by the research project revealed  that roughly 50 percent of all buildings with a POPS had at least one space  apparently out-of-compliance with applicable legal requirements resulting in  some degree of privatization.&nbsp;The types of privatization organized  themselves into three categories: denial of public access, annexation of public  space by adjacent private uses, and diminution of required  amenities.&nbsp;Locked gates would prevent public access during hours when the  space was required to be open.&nbsp;A building representative would incorrectly  inform the public that the space was for tenant use only.&nbsp;Required public  restrooms would be declared off-limits to all but tenants.&nbsp;Without  securing the necessary city approval, brasserie bulge, café creep, and  trattoria trickle would make parts of the public space inaccessible to  individuals unable or unwilling to purchase food or drink. Required seating  would be absent or rendered unusable by spikes, plant material would be missing  or dead, water fountains would not work. Recent POPS field visits reveal  continuing problems at some spaces.</p>

      <p>It  may be helpful for Participants to familiarize themselves with the current  standards for POPS signage for public plazas specified in Section 37-751 of the  New York City Zoning Resolution, available online at  <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/zoning/zoning-text/art03c07.pdf"><strong>https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/zoning/zoning-text/art03c07.pdf</strong></a>, and excerpted below. The symbol #  surrounding a word or phrase indicates a defined term in the Zoning Resolution.  The definitions are set forth in Article I, Chapter 2, or within the chapters  where the definitions apply. The public space symbol referenced in Section  37-751(a)(1) is the POPS logo that this Competition seeks to replace. </p>
