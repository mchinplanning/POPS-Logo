      <a name="overview"></a><h2><strong>About the Competition</strong></h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Anyone who has spent time in New York City&rsquo;s  densest commercial and residential neighborhoods will have noticed street-level  plazas, atriums, and arcades next to or within privately owned office and  residential towers. Some of these spaces look like small parks, others are  hardscaped expanses. Many are filled with people eating lunch, meeting friends,  reading, or people watching, while others are underutilized. Most of these  spaces, however, share one characteristic: known as privately owned public  spaces (POPS), each is legally required to be open to the public and for public  use. </p>
      <p>Since 1961, New York City has offered floor area  bonuses and other zoning incentives to private developers of office and  residential buildings to encourage them to provide the more than 550 POPS that  are scattered about the city, especially in the borough of Manhattan and  increasingly in Brooklyn and Queens. Combined,  the city&rsquo;s POPS provide nearly&nbsp;3.8  million square&nbsp;feet&nbsp;of additional public space – equivalent to  nine Bryant Parks, 24 Union Squares, or 10% of Central Park. Each POPS has a distinct identity shaped by its design, location,  applicable legal requirements, owner and manager, and users. </p>
      <p>For POPS to be well used by the public, it is  imperative that residents, workers, and visitors know which spaces are indeed  POPS and what amenities are required. For example, during what hours is a space  required to be open? Must it provide amenities such as seating, landscaping,  water fountains, bathrooms, or bike racks? If members of the public have a  question about the space, whom should they contact? The New York City Zoning  Resolution, from 1975 onward, has obliged almost all POPS owners to post  signage on-site, identifying the space as a POPS and specifying required hours  of access and amenities. Signage must also include information about who owns  and manages the space and to whom a complaint may be submitted. </p>
      <p>In 2017, the City enacted a new law requiring that  all POPS, including those previously not obligated to do so, display POPS  signage. The adoption of the new law and the renewed attention it has brought  to POPS afford an opportunity to reconsider more broadly the character of POPS  signage. One element of special interest is the POPS logo. For many years, the  Zoning Resolution has required POPS owners subject to the signage requirement  to utilize a logo commissioned by the City decades ago from the graphic design  firm Chermayeff &amp; Geismar. As POPS have grown in number and diversity of  design and use, the time has come to explore a new logo design that graphically  represents the evolving nature of POPS and that creates a unified visual  identity for the City&rsquo;s POPS program. </p>
<p><a href="https://apops.mas.org/"><b>Advocates  for Privately Owned Public Space</b></a>,  the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/pops"><b>New  York City Department of City Planning </b></a> (“the Department”), and <a href="https://www.mas.org/"><b>The Municipal Art Society of New York</b></a> (the &ldquo;Sponsors&rdquo;) have joined forces to sponsor a  design competition (the &ldquo;Competition&rdquo;) for a new POPS logo to be utilized on  POPS signage throughout the city and to represent the face of New York City&rsquo;s  POPS program, with funding provided in part by <strong><a href="https://www.knoll.com/">Knoll</a></strong>. Submissions are invited from  anyone or any entity worldwide. Submissions will be posted online and displayed  at a public exhibition during the Competition. A seven-person panel, along with  a public vote that will be counted in the panel evaluations as the equivalent  of an additional eighth panel member, will select a maximum of three Awardees  for their Submissions. The Director  of the Department of City Planning (the &ldquo;Director&rdquo;) on behalf of the Department may then choose one of the Awardees&rsquo; logos to become the  official New York City POPS logo. Awardees will each receive $2,000 and be  honored at a public event. The Awardee of the logo  chosen by the Director as the official New  York City POPS logo will receive an additional $2,000. Submissions are due by Friday, March 15, 2019. Awardees and the Director&rsquo;s choice will be  announced on Monday, May 20, 2019.</p>

   <p><a href="https://apops.mas.org/"><b>Advocates  for Privately Owned Public Space</b></a> (APOPS) is a private, not-for-profit organization founded by Harvard  University professor Jerold S. Kayden in 2005 to promote greater public  awareness and use of New York City&rsquo;s 550 or so zoning-created plazas, arcades,  and other outdoor and indoor spaces known as privately owned public spaces.  APOPS has worked diligently to ensure that comprehensive and accurate knowledge  about POPS locations and legal requirements are available and that owners  observe applicable legal requirements with regard to public access and use.  Working with The  Municipal Art Society of New York, APOPS introduced in 2012 the <a href="https://apops.mas.org/"><strong>first-ever  comprehensive website</strong></a> containing an interactive map and detailed profiles of every POPS in the city. APOPS engages cooperatively with owners, civic groups, city agencies, community boards, and members of the public to improve POPS.<br>

      <p>The <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/index.page"><b>New  York City Department of City Planning</b></a> (DCP) is New York City&rsquo;s primary land use agency  and is instrumental in designing the City&rsquo;s physical and socioeconomic  framework. DCP works to make New York City a better, fairer and more equitable  city for all to live, work and play. The 1961 Zoning Resolution inaugurated the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/pops"><strong>POPS program</strong></a> by introducing the innovative incentive zoning  tool that allowed additional floor area in a building when developers provided  publicly accessible plazas and arcades. Over the intervening decades, many  other types of outdoor and indoor POPS have been introduced in the Zoning  Resolution as the Department of City Planning expanded the program and refined  design and operational standards. The Department is committed to ensuring that  all POPS are serving the public, and to continually enhancing design standards  in order to ensure that POPS are of high quality, useful, and inviting for the  public.</p>

      <p>Created  in 1893 by Richard Morris Hunt and a circle of civic-minded activists, MAS was  founded with a mission to beautify the city through public art. Our advocacy  efforts have led to the creation of the New York City Planning Commission,  Public Design Commission, Landmarks Preservation Commission, and the Tribute in  Light; the preservation of Grand Central Terminal, the lights of Times Square,  and the Garment District; the conservation of more than 50 works of public art;  and the founding of such civic organizations as the Public Art Fund, the New  York Landmarks Conservancy, P.S. 1, the Historic Districts Council, the Park  Avenue Armory Conservancy, and the Waterfront Alliance. </p>
