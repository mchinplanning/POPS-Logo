<p align="justify"><strong>Logo Statement: </strong><br>
  POPS are everywhere, hidden oases in an urban forest of glass, steel, and concrete. They come in all shapes and sizes, forming a network of treasured public spaces - spaces in which all can relax, eat, socialize, and explore. </P> 

<p align="justify">In the same way, our logo unites active and diverse shapes into one recognizable symbol. The tree makes a single statement, but close-up one can see the network of parts that form the whole. </p>

<p align="justify">POPS are part of a city in constant motion. Our design captures this energy by encouraging the eye to move across a dynamic, playful composition. The rounded shapes feel friendly and approachable but are grounded in the structure of an implied “city” grid. In this way, it recognizes the iconic original logo. However, by unlocking it from the original bounding box we make it feel accessible and welcoming. </p>

  New York’s constellation of Privately Owned Public Spaces constitute a distributed commons; a city-wide array of shared space. Through peoples everyday use – resting, reflecting, playing, convening – these spaces are invested with meaning and transfomed from abstract space into active public places.</p>

      <p><strong>#624, "The Statue Of Liberty Having A Break"<br>Submitted by Derek Pommer</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">
My name is Derek Pommer, I am a Canadian-born graphic artist and illustrator based in Muenster, Germany.  After having studied Graphic Design/Visual Communication in Germany, I started out working exclusively in advertising. Over the years I gradually feeled the desire to work more artistic which is why I additionally specialized on illustration. Since the first part of my childhood took place in Canada before I moved to a different continent, I always kept up my roots. Probably this is why I like to think and work globally, internationally. 
This competition appears to be a chance to do so.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Logo Statement: </strong><br>
  In my design for a new POPS-logo, I chose to illustrate the Statue Of Liberty in a slightly unusual, relaxed pose. Apart from the Empire State Building, this is the symbol par excellence for New York City and is internationally well-understood by residents and tourists. In my opinion, this is a likeable image of the famous icon with a bit of humorous content: Lady Liberty has simply put aside her torch and tablet to have a break on an indicated park bench, and she does this with a whiff of a smile. As a personification of this metropole, she serves as a guide to those in search of a recreation possibility.</p></font>

     <p><font size="3"><strong>#479, &quot;POPS Nolli" <br>Submitted by Ryan Crooks</strong> <br>
       </font></p><font size="3">
<p align="justify">Ryan Crooks is an architect and professor in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Logo Statement:</strong><br>
The POPS Nolli logo shows a representation of a bench within a square with contrasting fields of black and white that create figure ground relationships similar to those in Giambattista Nolli’s 1748 Plan of Rome engravings, where the private structures are represented as solid black and the public spaces, including piazzas, cortiles, and religious structure interiors, are shown without color or hatching, simply defined by the black of the surrounding private structures. The logo’s white field is in the Golden ratio, providing visual dominance to that of the public realm, while the black of the private defines the square and bounds the white field, showing that the public space is within the private domain. The implied white square in the logo’s upper right provides visual interest but can be considered a play on the traditional square or common, where citizens have met and interacted over hundreds of years.</p>
