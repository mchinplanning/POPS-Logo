<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Selection Process and Department of City Planning Director's Choice</u></strong></h3>
      <p align="left"><em>Summary: </em>The process for selecting up to three Awardees of the Competition combines the selections of a seven-member panel with the selections of a public vote that is weighted as if rendered by an additional eighth panel member. The Director may select one of the Awardees&rsquo; logos to become the official New York City POPS logo.</p>
<p><em>Anonymity: </em>In order to ensure that  the selections of the panel, public vote, and choice of the official New York  City POPS logo are based solely on the  Submission and not on the identity  of the Participant, the identities of all Participants will remain anonymous to  members of the panel and their employees, the Sponsors and their employees, the  Competition Advisor and Advisory Committee, Knoll and its employees, and  members of the public until Awardees are publicly announced, except that  certain designated employees or representatives of the Sponsors will be  responsible for processing submitted materials and providing them in an  anonymized format and without the Biography to the panel, the Competition  Advisor and Advisory Committee, and the public.</p>
<p>Material submitted by Participants other than the Biography may  not include any text or graphic information that would allow for identification  of the Participant. Participants and anyone acting on their behalf may not  communicate with members of the panel and their employees, the Sponsors and  their employees, the Competition Advisor and Advisory Committee, Knoll and its  employees, and members of the public about their Submissions or any subject  related to the Competition, except that Participants and anyone acting on their  behalf may ask anonymized questions through the Competition Website that may be  answered by the Competition Advisory Committee. Participants may not publicize  their logos prior to the Competition&rsquo;s announcement of Awardees and the  Department of City Planning&rsquo;s announcement of the Director&rsquo;s  choice from among the Awardees&rsquo; Submissions of an official New York City POPS  logo. Failure of a Participant to follow these requirements may result in  disqualification.</p>
 
<p><em>Public  Vote:</em> Members of the public  will be able to view all logos and logo narratives online beginning Wednesday,  March 20, 2019, 12:00 p.m. EST, and at a public exhibition in March 2019  (specific date, time, and place to be announced on the Competition Website).  Members of the public may vote only once for only one logo through a form,  provided on the Competition Website, between Wednesday, March 20, 2019, 12:00  p.m. EST and Tuesday, April 2, 2019, 12:00 p.m. EST. The three logos that  receive the most votes from members of the public will be incorporated into the  panel selection process as if the three were the selections of an additional eighth  panel member.</p>
<p><em>Panel Selection:</em> The seven-person panel  will review all logos and logo narratives and, in combination with the public  vote that counts as if it were the selections of an additional eighth panel  member will select a maximum of three Awardees.</p>
<p><em>Department of City Planning Director’s Choice of Official New York City POPS Logo:</em> The Director may choose one of the Awardees&rsquo; logos to  become the official New York City POPS logo. The Department of City Planning,  with the agreement and cooperation of the Awardee whose logo has been chosen by  the Department to be the official New York City POPS logo may make minor  alterations to the logo. If the Director  decides not to choose one of the Awardees&rsquo; logos, the Director may not choose another logo submitted for the  Competition.</p>
<div>
  <div> </div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Payment</u></strong><br></h3>
      <p>A payment of $2,000 will be provided to each Awardee. The  Awardee that created the logo chosen as the official New York City POPS logo  will receive an additional $2,000 payment.</p>
      <p> Notwithstanding the above, if a Participant who is a City  employee eligible to participate in the Competition is selected as an Awardee  or chosen as the creator of the official New York City POPS logo, then that  Participant may not receive any payment unless the Participant obtains a waiver  from the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board. Participants who are DCP employees, their immediate family, or their household  members may not receive any payments under any circumstances. Awardees of the Competition  are responsible for all taxes associated with payments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

      
     <h3><strong><u>Ownership of Logos</u></strong></h3>
      <p>The logo  chosen to become the official New York City POPS logo will become the property  of the City of New York. The Participant who has  submitted that logo (or the Participant&rsquo;s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) on behalf  of Participant, as applicable) will transfer all rights in and to the logo and  all rights to license its use, modification, and use in secondary works for all  purposes, including advertisements or program publicity, to the City of New  York.</p>
      <p>The Department of City Planning will procure  the chosen logo pursuant to New York City Procurement Policy Board Rules  Section 3-08. The Awardee who created the logo chosen to be the official New  York City POPS logo will be considered a vendor for the purposes of the  procurement and agrees and understands that she, he, or it will have to  register as a vendor with the City of New York. Other Awardees whose logos were  not chosen by the Director agree and understand that they may also be required  to register as a vendor. Failure to register with the City of New York as a  vendor, if required, will mean that the Department will not use the chosen logo  and that the non-registering Awardees will not receive payments.   <br>
        <br>
        The Awardees whose logos were not chosen to  become the official New York City POPS logo will retain ownership but will  grant a limited display license to the City for the purpose of displaying the  Awardee Submissions on publicity materials and in furtherance of the selection  process.</p>
      <p>Ownership of all other logos not chosen to  become the official New York City POPS logo will be retained by the  Participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Use of Submissions During and After the Competition</u>
</strong></h3>
      <p>All Participants agree  that any and all materials submitted as part of their Submissions may be used  by the Sponsors as part of promoting and documenting the Competition during and  after the Competition in any media worldwide without payment or consideration.  Use of the logo chosen as the official New York City POPS logo on POPS signage,  in the City&rsquo;s Zoning Resolution, or in other POPS-related materials published  by the Sponsors may, but need not, carry a line crediting the Participant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The Sponsors  reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to disqualify any Submission from any  Participant or his/her parent or legal guardian who tampers directly or  indirectly with the Competition process. The Sponsors assume no responsibility  for any error, deletion, defect, or delay in operation or transmission,  communication failure, theft, destruction or unauthorized access to, or  alteration of, the Submissions that is beyond the reasonable control of the  Sponsors and which may corrupt or affect the fairness, integrity, security, or  administration of the Competition. If there is any dispute as to the identity  of a Participant, the decision of Sponsors may disqualify the Submission unless  the dispute is resolved by the purported Participant to the satisfaction of the  Sponsors.</p>
<p><em>Reservation of Rights</em>: The Sponsors reserve the right to modify or terminate this Competition at any time without notice. The Sponsors are not liable for any damage, loss, inconvenience, or injury suffered by anyone due to any such modification or termination. The Sponsors are not liable for any damage, loss, inconvenience, or injury suffered by anyone due to any errors or negligence or other action that may arise out of, or in connection with, the Competition.  </p>

To the extent  considered necessary by the Sponsors, any payments due to a Participant hereunder  may be withheld until all claims for indemnification have been resolved, and any  amount withheld shall not be subject to the payment of interest by any of the  Sponsors. This clause shall survive expiration or termination of the arrangements  hereunder.</p>
<p align="left">The Sponsors are not responsible for (1) any incorrect or  inaccurate information, whether caused by Participants, printing errors, or by  any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the  Competition; (2) technical failures of any kind, including, but not limited to  malfunctions, interruptions, or disconnections in phone lines or network  hardware or software; (3) unauthorized human intervention in any part of the  Submission process or other aspects of the Competition; (4) any unauthorized  use of a Submission by any third party; (5) technical or human error which may  occur in the administration of the Competition or the processing of  Submissions; or (6) any injury or damage to persons or property which may be  caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from a  Participant's  participation in the Competition or receipt or use or misuse of any payment. If  for any reason a Participant's Submission is confirmed to have been erroneously  deleted, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, a Participant's sole  remedy is another Submission in the Competition.</p>
<div>
  <div> </div>
  <div> </div>
